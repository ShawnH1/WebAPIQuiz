            Hello and welcome to this Javascript Coding Quiz.  When you click the "Start Quiz" button below, some questions will appear.
            Simply click on the correct answer.  
            <!--Teach them the rules and time limit-->
            There is a 10 second penalty for each wrong answer.  If time runs out, the quiz will end
            automatically.
            <br>
            <!--Notify them of upcoming features-->
            <br>
            Coming soon:
            Score will be calculated by multiplying the number
            of correct answers by the remaining time, more questions, additional styling, sound effects, and visual feedback!
            <br>
            Thank you for your patience and have a nice day!
        </p>
